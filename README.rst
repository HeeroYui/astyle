This is a modified version of astyle: http://astyle.sourceforge.net

Our intention is to patch astyle to follow the Steinwurf coding style
as closely as possible: http://docs.steinwurf.com/coding_style.html

Steinwurf uses heavily-templated C++11 code that can be a true challenge
for a code formatting tool.
